# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up your Playwright automation project on GitHub as a portfolio piece.

## üöÄ Step 1: Create a New Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `playwright-automation`
   - **Description**: `A comprehensive end-to-end testing automation framework built with Playwright`
   - **Visibility**: Public (for portfolio)
   - **Initialize with**: Don't initialize (we'll push existing code)

## üîß Step 2: Prepare Your Local Repository

### Initialize Git (if not already done)
```bash
cd /Users/Apple/Documents/GitHub/playwright-automation
git init
```

### Add your files
```bash
git add .
```

### Create initial commit
```bash
git commit -m "feat: initial commit - Playwright automation framework

- Add comprehensive test suite for WELL compliance dashboard
- Implement Page Object Model pattern
- Configure CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Add security best practices with environment variables
- Include detailed documentation and contributing guidelines"
```

## üîó Step 3: Connect to GitHub

### Add remote origin
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/playwright-automation.git
```

### Push to GitHub
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Configure Repository Settings

### 1. Repository Settings
- Go to your repository on GitHub
- Click "Settings" tab
- Under "General":
  - Add a description
  - Add topics: `playwright`, `automation`, `testing`, `e2e`, `qa`
  - Enable "Issues" and "Discussions"

### 2. Branch Protection (Optional)
- Go to "Branches" in Settings
- Add rule for `main` branch:
  - Require pull request reviews
  - Require status checks to pass
  - Include administrators

### 3. GitHub Actions
- Go to "Actions" tab
- The workflow will run automatically on your first push

## üîí Step 5: Set Up Environment Variables (for CI/CD)

### For GitHub Actions
1. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Add the following secrets:
   - `TEST_EMAIL`: Your test account email
   - `TEST_PASSWORD`: Your test account password
   - `API_KEY`: Any API keys needed for testing

### For Local Development
1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env` with your actual test credentials
3. **Never commit this file** (it's in `.gitignore`)

## üìä Step 6: Verify Everything Works

### Test Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install browsers
npm run install-browsers

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Check GitHub Actions
1. Go to "Actions" tab on GitHub
2. Verify the workflow runs successfully
3. Check that test artifacts are uploaded
